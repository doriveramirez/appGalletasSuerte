I can't finish this app because I have an amd ryzen processor and Android Studio needs to use a Intel function that I don't have, the hypothetical solution could be activating Hyper-V in my OS, but I have this problem

Anyways, the only thing that it lacks in the android app is the implementation of the /list system, which is unfinished because I couldn't get it to work in these moment.

There are various aspects in my app that my professor didn't explained in class, as the dialog alert, the reset of the times that a phrase has appeared to you, and many more!
