I can't finish this app because I have an amd ryzen processor and Android Studio needs to use a Intel function that I don't have, the hypothetical solution could be activating Hyper-V in my OS, but I have this problem

Anyways, the only thing that it lacks in the android app is the implementation of the /list system.
